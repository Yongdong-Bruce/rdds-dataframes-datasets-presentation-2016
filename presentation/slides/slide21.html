  <h1>Some Dataset Limitations</h1>

      They're not especially useful for Python.

      They can still be slower than DataFrames (because of the lambdas).
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      In some cases, RDD lambdas may still be faster than the equivalent
      Dataset lambda.
      <ul>
        <li class="fragment">
          If the JVM isn't garbage-collecting, then RDDs might be faster,
          because they operate directly on JVM objects. Once the JVM starts GC,
          though, Dataset lambdas will tend to be faster (because the data
          lives outside the heap).

          (The Spark developers think they can fix this problem.)

      The term "Datasets" is kind of hard to Google...
