  <h1>Datasets and Serialization</h1>

  <p>
    Spark has to serialize data <span class="fragment">... a <i>lot</i>.</span>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">
      Dataset serialization uses custom bytecode generated <i>at runtime</i>.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      As a result, serialization can be significantly faster than either
      native Java or Kryo serialization.
    </li>

    <li class="fragment">
      The resulting serialized data will often be up to 2x smaller, as well,
      which reduces disk use and network use.
    </li>
  </ul>
